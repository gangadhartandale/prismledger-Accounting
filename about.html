      <h2>Meet Gangadhar Tandale</h2>

      <p>
        Gangadhar Tandale is the Accounting Manager at <strong>Prismledger Accounting Services</strong>, where he is
        dedicated to supporting individuals, newcomers and small business owners with clear, reliable and affordable
        accounting solutions. His approach is grounded in accuracy, integrity and a genuine commitment to helping clients
        stay compliant and confident in their financial responsibilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gangadhar brings extensive experience across <strong>tax filing, bookkeeping, payroll, audit and collections</strong>,
        allowing him to understand both sides of compliance – the <strong>CRA perspective</strong> and the
        <strong>client experience</strong>. His background includes roles at respected accounting firms in Vancouver such as
        <strong>MNP LLP, Manning Elliott LLP and Buckley Dodds CPA LLP</strong>, where he gained hands-on experience serving
        a wide range of clients and industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        He founded <strong>Prismledger Accounting Services</strong> with a mission to help individuals and small businesses
        who struggle with tax compliance, outstanding balances and collection challenges. His recent tenure with the
        <strong>Government of Canada</strong> as an <strong>Income Tax Collections Officer</strong> provided deep insight into
        how the CRA initiates legal actions, garnishments, liens and other enforcement measures. With this knowledge, he
        helps clients <strong>avoid stressful collection situations</strong> and resolve tax matters proactively and
        respectfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gangadhar is currently preparing for the <strong>Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)</strong> designation to
        further strengthen his technical expertise and continue delivering high-quality professional services. He has also
        contributed to the community as a volunteer with the <strong>City of Vancouver’s Community Tax Clinic</strong>,
        where he completed <strong>over 300 tax filings</strong> for low-income individuals and newcomers.
      </p>

      <p>
        To complement his accounting background, Gangadhar has completed the <strong>IBM Data Analytics Essentials</strong>
        and <strong>IBM Data Visualization &amp; Dashboard Essentials</strong> certificates, enhancing his ability to interpret
        financial data, create clear dashboards and communicate insights in a way that clients can easily understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of his professional work, Gangadhar is passionate about financial education and empowering newcomers to
        Canada by helping them understand their tax obligations, available credits and financial rights.
