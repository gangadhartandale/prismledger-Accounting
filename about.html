            Prismledger Accounting Service was created to make accounting and tax simple for
            everyday business owners. We know that most entrepreneurs don’t enjoy spreadsheets,
            reconciliations, or tax forms—but we do.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Whether you are running a small retail shop, restaurant, or professional practice, we
            focus on clear communication, reliable deadlines, and practical advice so you can make
            better decisions with your numbers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our services are designed to be flexible and affordable, so you can start small and
            add more support as your business grows.

          <h3>Your Accounting Partner</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> Gangadhar Tandale<br />
            <strong>Role:</strong> Accounting Manager
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With hands-on experience in bookkeeping, tax filing, and payroll for small
            businesses, I understand the deadlines and requirements of the Canada Revenue Agency
            (CRA) and how stressful they can feel if you’re on your own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I work closely with clients, explaining things in plain language and helping them stay
            organized and compliant throughout the year—not just at tax time.
